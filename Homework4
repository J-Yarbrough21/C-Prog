/*
Description/Requirements
• You will write a program to simulate ten thousand (10000) rolls of a  randomly sided die, and calculate the mean, the variance, the standard deviation, and the standard error of the mean for the result.

• In order to run this simulation, your program will need to perform the following steps:

   ◦ Your program will ask the user for an integer number  from 2 to 100 to represent the number of sides the die will have ◦ Your program will make sure that the user entered a number from 2 to 100; if not, the program should continue to ask until a valid value for S is obtained.

  ◦ Your program will then “roll a die” 10,000 times – it will pick 10,000 random numbers from 1 to the number of sides the dice has, and will print out each result on it's own line.

  ◦ As your simulation is running, it will recording statistical information – see the next page for the calculations.

  ◦ When the simulation is done, it will print out the statistical results – the mean, the variance, the standard deviation, and the standard error of the mean.


Calculating statistical results for computer simulations.



When you have a sample consisting of a set of values, and you wish to compute the mean, the variance, the standard deviation, and the standard error of the mean, the best way to do this is to perform the following.

calculate the mean
get the variance.
for each number, subtract the mean and square the results
sum up the squared results.
find the mean of the squared results. Remember  to use (N-1)
this is the variance
get the square root of the variance.  This is the standard deviation.
The standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of N
