/*

Description/Requirements
You will write a program to solve quadratic equations

Your program will ask the users for the coefficients a, b, and c, and will then calculate and print both roots (solutions) for x, even if they are complex numbers.

Your program should  print an error if  a = 0.

If the roots are a pair of real numbers that differ, both should be displayed.

If there is only one (repeated) root, it should be displayed and the user should be told that it is a repeated root. • If the solution is a pair of complex numbers, they should be displayed in the form x = P + Qi and x = P −Qi where P and Q real numbers, and the symbol “i” represents the square root of -1.

It is strongly advised that you create a function to return the value of the “discriminant”, which is b2 −4ac

You may NOT use global variables.
Recall that solutions to a quadratic equation of the form

ax2 + bx + c = 0, where
a, b and c are real numbers and
a != 0
