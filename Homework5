#include <stdio.h>

/*

Write the code to deal 10 hands of 5 cards each.
• Your program should NOT ask the user for any information – just have it print out the hand of cards when you run the program.

• Each hand should be printed on its own line.

• Each card should be printed as a pair of characters in the following way:

   ◦ The first character should be from the set { A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, K } to indicate rank, with                          A=ace=1, T=ten=10, J=jack=11, Q=queen=12, K=king=13.

   ◦ The second character should be from the set { h, s, d, c } to indicate suit.

   ◦ Print the cards with a single space between them. Example : 7c Js 2h Ad Th


• You MUST use an array to represent a permutation of the deck of cards.

• You MUST use a separate function to shuffle the deck, passing an array to the function.

• You MUST use rand() in your algorithm to shuffle the deck.

• You cannot have any repeated cards in a single hand. (obvious?)
